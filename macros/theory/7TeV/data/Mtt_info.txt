This is a finely binned estimate for dsigma/dmttbar and 1/sigma dsigma/dmttbar. 

1)You can convert it to any binning by integrating  dsigma/dmttbar *Delta:

In Lilin words

Hi Francesco,
The values I gave you are d\sigma/dMtt, not d\sigma/bin. So you will
need to multiply those by the bin size (25 GeV) to get the latter. The
total would be 0.04*25=1.


2) This si what Lilin was writing  as description:

I attached a data file for d\sigma/dMtt, 

*)
the columns  for the unnormalized results are:

Mtt (center of bin), \sigma(default), \sigma(+scale), \sigma(-scale), \sigma(+pdf), \sigma(-pdf).

Note that the cross sections are in pb/GeV in , not pb/bin.

*) 
the columns for the normalized results are the same but the results are scaled 1/sigma_tot * dsigma/dmttbar


Cheers,
Francesco
