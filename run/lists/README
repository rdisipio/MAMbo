jk, june 2015:

some guidance fo making eos lists:

./MakeSigList.sh
which also autoamtically splits the filelist for the main signal.

(Depricated:
  from existing list_eos_new.txt
  stream it to el, mu, mc:
  ./Stream.sh)


then you can run over signal on lxplus PBS as:
cd ../
scripts/sendMCsigDileptonSplitScripts_lxbatch.sh
scripts/sendMCsigHalvesSplitScripts_lxbatch.sh
scripts/sendMCTruthSplitScripts_lxbatch.sh


Data and Bg samples:
 . ./ListEos.sh | grep root > ListMarinoNew.sh
./MakeBgList.sh
./MakeDataList.sh

then you can run oved data locally as
cd ../
./scripts/run_data_locally.sh
